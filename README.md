How i make the zip for Release.

```

# How i Made This Repo & Get The Deb Files

First I need Curl Package to work with.

```
sudo apt install curl -y
```

As Official Brave Keyring need to install the browser, so i need to add the keyring in my path.

```
sudo curl -fsSLo /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave.com/static-assets/keys/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

sudo apt update
```


If i want to do this same with wget not with curl,

```
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg https://brave.com/static-assets/keys/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg

echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/brave-browser-archive-keyring.gpg arch=amd64] https://brave-browser-apt-release.s3.brave.com/ stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/brave-browser-release.list

sudo apt update
```

After This i need to downlaod the brave browser packages.
